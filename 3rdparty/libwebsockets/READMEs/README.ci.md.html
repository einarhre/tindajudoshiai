<h2 id="need-for-ci">Need for CI</h2>
<p>Generally if we’re adding something that’s supposed to work ongoing, the stuff should be exercised in CI (at least Travis).</p>
<p>If there are few users for a particular feature, experience has shown that refactors or other upheaval can easily break it into a state of uselessness without anyone noticing until later.</p>
<p>Therefore here’s a description of how to add something to the CI tests… this is certainly a nonproductive PITA and I have never been thanked for the work involved. But if the promise of the various features working is going to remain alive, it’s necessary to include CI test where possible with new nontrivial code.</p>

<p><code>.travis.yml</code> maps the various test activities to CMake options needed.</p>

<h2 id="contributing-to-lws">Contributing to lws</h2>
<h3 id="how-to-contribute">How to contribute</h3>
<p>Sending a patch with a bug report is very welcome.</p>
<p>For nontrivial problems, itâ€™s probably best to discuss on the mailing list, or on github if you prefer, how to best solve it.</p>
<p>However your contribution is coming is fine:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>paste a <code>git diff</code></p></li>
<li><p>send a patch series by mail or mailing list</p></li>
<li><p>paste in a github issue</p></li>
<li><p>github PR</p></li>
</ul>
<p>are all OK.</p>
<h3 id="coding-standards">Coding Standards</h3>
<p>Code should look roughly like the existing code, which follows linux kernel coding style.</p>
<p>If there are non-functional problems I will clean them out when I apply the patch.</p>
<p>If there are functional problems (eg broken error paths etc) if they are small compared to the working part I will also clean them. If there are larger problems, or consequences to the patch will have to discuss how to solve them with a retry.</p>
<h3 id="funding-specific-work">Funding specific work</h3>
<p>If there is a feature you wish was supported in lws, consider paying for the work to be done. The maintainer is a consultant and if we can agree the task, you can quickly get a high quality result that does just what you need, maintained ongoing along with the rest of lws.</p>
